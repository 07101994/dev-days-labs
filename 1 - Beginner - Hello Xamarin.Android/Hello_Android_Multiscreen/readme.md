# Handling Navigation with Xamarin.Android  

In this two-part guide, we expand the Phoneword application we created in the Hello, Android guide to handle a second screen. Along the way we introduce the basic Android Application Building Blocks and dive deeper into Android architecture as we develop a better understanding of Android application structure and functionality.   

##  [Part 1: Quickstart](https://github.com/xamarin/dev-days-labs/tree/master/1%20-%20Beginner%20-%20Hello%20Xamarin.Android/Hello_Android_Mutliscreen/quickstart/)

In the first part of this guide we’ll add a second screen to our Phoneword application to keep track of the history of numbers called using our app. The final application will have a second screen that displays the call history.

##  [Part 2: Deep Dive](https://github.com/xamarin/dev-days-labs/tree/master/1%20-%20Beginner%20-%20Hello%20Xamarin.Android/Hello_Android_Multiscreen/deepdive/)

In the second part of this document, we review what we’ve built and discuss architecture, navigation, and other new Android concepts that we encounter along the way.
