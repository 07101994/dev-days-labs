##  Hello, Android

Brand new to Xamarin and Android? You landed in the perfect place. We have two labs to walk you through your very first Android application build completely in C#. Get started with Hello, Android below.

##  [Hello, Android](https://github.com/xamarin/dev-days-labs/tree/master/1%20-%20Beginner%20-%20Hello%20Xamarin.Android/Hello_Android)

In this two-part guide, we build our first Xamarin.Android application using Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio and develop an understanding of the fundamentals of Android application development with Xamarin. Along the way weâ€™ll introduce the tools, concepts, and steps required to build and deploy a Xamarin.Android application.



##  [Hello, Android Multiscreen](https://github.com/xamarin/dev-days-labs/tree/master/1%20-%20Beginner%20-%20Hello%20Xamarin.Android/Hello_Android_Multiscreen)

In this two-part guide, we expand the application we created in the Hello, Android guide to handle a second screen. Along the way we introduce the basic Android *Application Building Blocks* and dive deeper into Android architecture as we develop a better understanding of Android application structure and functionality.
