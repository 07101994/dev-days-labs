# Introduction to iOS Development with Xamarin  

In this two-part guide, we build our first Xamarin.iOS application using Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio and develop an understanding of the fundamentals of iOS application development with Xamarin. Along the way we’ll introduce the tools, concepts, and steps required to build and deploy a Xamarin.iOS application.  

##  [Part 1: Quickstart](https://github.com/xamarin/dev-days-labs/tree/master/1%20-%20Beginner%20-%20Hello%20Xamarin.iOS/Hello_iOS/quickstart/)

In the first part of this guide we’ll create an application that translates an alphanumeric phone number entered by the user into a numeric phone number, and then calls that number.

##  [Part 2: Deep Dive](https://github.com/xamarin/dev-days-labs/tree/master/1%20-%20Beginner%20-%20Hello%20Xamarin.iOS/Hello_iOS/deepdive/)

In the second part of this document, we’ll review what we’ve built and develop a fundamental understanding of how iOS applications work.
