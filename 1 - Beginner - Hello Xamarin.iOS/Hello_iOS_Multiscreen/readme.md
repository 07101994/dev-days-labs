# Hello, iOS Multiscreen  

Handling Navigation with Xamarin.iOS  

In this two-part guide, we expand the Phoneword application we created in the Hello, iOS guide to handle a second screen. Along the way we’ll introduce the Model-View-Controller design pattern, implement our first iOS navigation, and develop a deeper understanding of iOS application structure and functionality.  

##  [Part 1: Quickstart](https://github.com/xamarin/dev-days-labs/tree/master/1%20-%20Beginner%20-%20Hello%20Xamarin.iOS/Hello_iOS_Multiscreen/quickstart/)

In the first part of this guide we’ll add a second screen to our Phoneword application to keep track of the history of numbers called using our app.

##  [Part 2: Deep Dive](https://github.com/xamarin/dev-days-labs/tree/master/1%20-%20Beginner%20-%20Hello%20Xamarin.iOS/Hello_iOS_Multiscreen/deepdive/)

In the second part of this document, we’ll review what we’ve built and discuss architecture, navigation, and other new iOS concepts that we encounter along the way.
