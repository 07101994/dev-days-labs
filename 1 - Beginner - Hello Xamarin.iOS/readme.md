# Getting Started with iOS  

From Hello World to Hello App Store  

Xamarin.iOS allows us to create native iOS applications using the same UI controls we would in Objective-C and Xcode, except with the flexibility and elegance of a modern language (C#), the power of the .NET Base Class Library (BCL), and two first-class IDEs - Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio - at our fingertips. This series introduces the basics of Xamarin.iOS development. It will take us from running our first app to building multi-screen applications that run on multiple devices. Let's get started!  


# Getting Started Series

##  [Setup and Installation](http://developer.xamarin/guides/ios/getting_started/installation/)

Get Xamarin.iOS set up and running in Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio. This section covers downloading, installation using the Xamarin Installer, linking Xamarin.iOS to your Xamarin Store account (activation), common troubleshooting items, device provisioning, and more.

##  [Hello, iOS](https://github.com/xamarin/dev-days-labs/tree/master/1%20-%20Beginner%20-%20Hello%20Xamarin.iOS/Hello_iOS)

In this two-part guide, we build our first Xamarin.iOS application using Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio and develop an understanding of the fundamentals of iOS application development with Xamarin. Along the way we’ll introduce the tools, concepts, and steps required to build and deploy a Xamarin.iOS application.

##  [Hello, iOS Multiscreen](https://github.com/xamarin/dev-days-labs/tree/master/1%20-%20Beginner%20-%20Hello%20Xamarin.iOS/Hello_iOS_Multiscreen/)

In this two-part guide, we expand the application we created in the Hello, iOS guide to handle a second screen. Along the way we’ll introduce the Model-View-Controller design pattern, implement our first iOS navigation, and develop a deeper understanding of iOS application structure and functionality.
